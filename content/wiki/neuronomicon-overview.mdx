The Neuronomicon is a shared cinematic universe spanning multiple stories, each
set in a distinct world but connected by common themes: augmentation, survival,
and the cost of power.

## Stories

- **Star Wyrms** — orbital military fiction. Humanity bonds with space dragons to
  defend the last colonies.
- **Grind Fighter** — neon-dystopia arena fiction. Survival means fighting for the
  crowd, and for something worth dying for.
